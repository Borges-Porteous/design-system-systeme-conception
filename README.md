Canada.ca design library - evidence-based patterns &amp; templates

In order to move towards a more flexible design system, the plan is to “decouple” the detailed specs of the templates and patterns from the official “policy documents” - the [Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specification](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification.html) and [Canada.ca Content Style Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-style-guide.html).
 
Specs 2.0 would only contain the mandatory parts of the design system, while all the patterns and templates (working name: “recommended patterns”, since template seems so “fixed” and impossible to tweak) would be available outside of the specs, in a design library. 
 
The first step will be to copy over the current templates and patterns into this repo. 
 
The vision would then be to gradually improve each pattern and template and make into usable code (rather than pictures) with instructions. We could also have a separate library of “experimental patterns and templates”, that we could open up to the whole community. We would need to eventually develop a process involving the community for a pattern to go from “experimental” to “approved”.
